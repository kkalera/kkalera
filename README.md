👋 Hi there! I'm a self-taught developer currently pursuing my passion for data science at Turing College. My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity to understand the intricacies of technology, which has led me to explore and develop my skills in this ever-evolving field alongside my current profession.

🏗️ As a ship-to-shore crane operator, I have gained a unique perspective on the importance of efficiency, safety, and automation in the industry. This hands-on experience has further fueled my interest in robotics and automation, inspiring me to delve deeper into the world of programming and data science to find innovative solutions that can revolutionize the way we work.

🔍 My interests lie in the fascinating realm of computer vision, AI applications in the medical sector, and the endless possibilities of robotics and automation. I believe that these areas have the potential to transform the way we live and work, and I'm excited to be a part of this transformation.

🤖 In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with robotics projects and experimenting with AI algorithms to create innovative solutions for real-world problems.

🌐 I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or any other platform. Let's work together to create a smarter, more efficient, and healthier future for all!
