# ðŸ‘‹ Hi , Iâ€™m Kenneth.

## :arrow_forward: About me
I'm a self taught developer working on personal projects before and after my day job as a crane operator. 
Looking to build up a portfolio of ML projects to make a shift in work in the future or start a startup.

Mostly interested in working on ML based projects to solve real world problems.
